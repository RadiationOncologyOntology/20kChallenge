This repository contains code to  
- train a logistic regression model  
- validate a logistic regression model  
- compute summary statistics from data

in a distributed setting (master/site-architecture).

## Folder structure
`algorithms/` contains a folder with algorithm-specific code for each algorithm type  
`compiling/` contains code to compile/zip/sign MATLAB code for uploading it to the VLP  
`create_user_input_file/` contains code to create an input file for each algorithm  
`result_analysis/` contains code to read the VLP output  
`shared_code/` contains code shared by multiple algorithms  

## Requirements
This code is developed in MATLAB 2018a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Older MATLAB versions are probably not compatible. 
The code is developed for use with the Varian Learning Portal 2.1 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) but is possibly adaptable to a distributed learning infrastructure following a parallel (all sites execute their code simultaneously) and synchronous (the next iteration starts when all sites have sent results back to the master) master/site-architecture.

This repository uses code developed by others:
